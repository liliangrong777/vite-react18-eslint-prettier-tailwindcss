# Vite + React 18 + TS + TailwindCSS + ESLint + Prettier
This is a starter template for React (TypeScript) using Vite. I've also added TailwindCSS so you can style your app without writing CSS code, and ESLint+Prettier to analyze your code and suggest some optimizations.

You can find more about these technologies in the following links: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

### How to install
Just run the next command in a terminal (make sure that you have installed NPM).
```bash
npx degit liliangrong777/vite-react18-eslint-prettier-tailwindcss project-name
```

### How to start
```bash
npm run dev
```
After the installation of the dependencies run:

npm run dev
